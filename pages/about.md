# About

I am Bastien Jeannelle, a Cloud and Network Infrastructure master student / SRE engineer working student. I am passionate about Cloud and micro-services technologies, as well as automation, and setup my own environment to test and learn new tools in the cloud landscape. I did this blog to help people setup their own environment to play around with.
